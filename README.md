## üöÄ Starting

These instructions will permit you getting a copy of the project in your local machine for tests and developing. 

### üìã Requirements

#### Editing the source code:
* You will need a code editor installed in your machine, such as **VS Code** or **Visual Studio**.
* You must have .Net SDK installed
* You must have NodeJs installed

#### Local deployment
* For build and run the application in Docker containers, you should have Docker installed. In our develop environment, we have used **Docker Desktop**.
* Deployment on Kubertnetes in local machine, you could use **KinD**.


#### Obs.: All links for each setup could be found in **[Built With](https://github.com/rafapolmann/marajoara-cinema-management?readme=1#%EF%B8%8F-built-with)** section.


### ‚å®Ô∏è Clone Git Repository

For clone the repository in your local machine, you just create a folder, open a Terminal Command in this directory and execute the command below:


```
git clone https://github.com/rafapolmann/marajoara-cinema-management
```

#### Back-end editing
You should just open **Marajoara.Cinema.Management.sln** file with **Visual Studio**.

#### Front-end editing
You should just open **Marajoara.Cinema.Management.FrontEnd** directory with **VS Code**, open a new Terminal Command tab and execute the command below:

```
npm install
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Debugging execution

In this case the application will use SQL Server LocalDB.
* You must execute **Marajoara.Cinema.Management.Api** with **Visual Studio**.
* You need change the **environment.ts** file in **Marajoara.Cinema.Management.FrontEnd** to use port: **44328** in baseApiUrl.
* Open **Marajoara.Cinema.Management.FrontEnd** directory with **VS Code**, open a new Terminal Command tab and execute the command below:

```
ng serve
```
After above steps:
* Access this address: http://localhost:4200/
* Access the Swagger in this address: https://localhost:44328/swagger/index.html
